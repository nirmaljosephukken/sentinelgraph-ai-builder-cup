"""
Controlled evidence gathering (policy section 5).

In this round customer and analyst replies are not provided, so the agent simulates them. The simulator is
deliberately *evidence-consistent and transparent*: the reply it assumes is the one the graph evidence makes
most likely, it never looks at anything the agent could not see, and the assumption plus its basis is written
into `evidence_requests[].assumed_response`. Swapping this class for a real channel (SMS, app push, analyst
queue) requires no change to the agent.
