Customer dispute intake: a free-text message in any language becomes a structured alert matched to a real
transaction in the graph.

    message ("मैंने यह $49 की खरीदारी नहीं की")  ->  Gemini: language, English translation, claim, stated amount
                                                ->  code: the amount must appear in the customer's own words

                                                ->  alert (customer_report) for the investigation engine

Gemini only reads and translates. It never picks the transaction: matching is a graph lookup, and an amount the
customer did not write is discarded. If nothing matches, the intake asks the customer a follow-up question
instead of guessing.
